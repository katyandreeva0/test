    questions: [
      {
        question: "How does Varialex work?",
        answer: "Varialex combines engaging stories with smart learning features. You read stories with real plots, automatically generate flashcards from new vocabulary, and practice conversations with our AI Teacher. The system adapts to your level and interests, making language learning feel natural and enjoyable rather than like studying."
      },
      {
        question: "How is Varialex different from Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone?",
        answer: "While other apps focus on isolated exercises, Varialex integrates everything through progressive stories. You read, learn vocabulary in context. Start up a call with you AI Teacher at any time and start discussions around the story, grammar, phrasing, and more. It's like having a personal teacher who's always ready to listen."
      },
      {
        question: "Will Varialex replace my Spanish/French classes?",
        answer: "No, and we don't want it to! Varialex is perfect for supplementing formal instruction. Use it to practice between classes, reinforce what you learned, and build confidence for real conversations."
      },
      {
        question: "What exactly are tokens and how do they work?",
        answer: "Tokens unlock AI-powered features like conversations with your AI teacher and custom story generation on topics YOU choose. Core features like reading pre-generated stories, flashcards, and progress tracking are always free. You get 100 free tokens to try these premium features."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens when I use up my 100 free tokens?",
        answer: "You can continue using all the core features: reading pre-generated stories, reviewing vocabulary, tracking progress. Completely free. When you want more AI conversations or custom stories on your topics, you can purchase additional tokens. No subscription required."
      },
      {
        question: "Is this really suitable for DELE, DELF, and other exam preparation?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Our content is aligned with CEFR standards (A1-A2) in terms of vocabulary and sentence complexity. We focus on building language skills rather than just test-taking strategies. Early testers are working toward these exams and providing feedback on the preparation features."
      },
      {
        question: "How do custom stories work?",
        answer: "Using tokens, you can generate stories for job interviews, travel, or any topic you choose. All custom stories have real plots and engaging characters‚Äînot just random scenarios. Whether you need business vocabulary for work meetings or travel phrases for your upcoming trip, you'll practice with stories tailored to your actual life situations. This is different from our pre-generated stories (which are free) because these are created specifically for YOUR interests and needs."
      },
      {
        question: "What languages does Varialex currently support?",
        answer: "Currently, Varialex supports Spanish and French at A1-A2 levels. We're actively developing additional languages based on user demand and feedback from our Early Learners community. Stay tuned for updates on new language releases!"
      },
      {
        question: "Since this is early access, what should I expect?",
        answer: "You'll get full access to all current features and help shape the app's future. We're actively developing based on user feedback. You might encounter minor bugs, but you'll also be the first to try exciting new features. Plus, you get to influence what we build next!"
